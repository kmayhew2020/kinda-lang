# Epic #125 - Task 4: Documentation & Real-world Examples

## 🎯 Epic Context
**Epic #125: Probabilistic Control Flow Constructs** - Complete the fuzzy programming paradigm by adding probabilistic control over program flow structures.

## 📋 Task Overview
Create comprehensive documentation, real-world application examples, and usage guides for all Epic #125 probabilistic control flow constructs.

## 🔧 Documentation Requirements

### 1. Comprehensive Usage Guide

#### Individual Construct Documentation
Each construct requires complete documentation including:

**`~sometimes_while` Documentation**:
```markdown
## ~sometimes_while - Probabilistic Loop Continuation

### Syntax
```kinda
~sometimes_while condition:
    # Loop body
    action()
```

### Behavior
- Evaluates condition at each iteration
- If condition is false, loop terminates immediately
- If condition is true, probabilistic decision determines continuation
- Personality affects continuation probability

### Personality Behaviors
| Personality | Continuation Probability | Use Case |
|-------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| reliable    | 90%                    | Predictable loops with slight variation |
| cautious    | 75%                    | Conservative execution patterns |
| playful     | 60%                    | Moderate unpredictability |
| chaotic     | 40%                    | High variation, early termination likely |

### Examples
[Detailed examples for each personality mode]
```

#### Similar comprehensive documentation needed for:
- `~maybe_for` - Probabilistic collection iteration
- `~kinda_repeat(n)` - Fuzzy repetition counts  
- `~eventually_until` - Probabilistic termination conditions

### 2. Real-world Application Examples

#### Example 1: Fuzzy Batch Processing
```kinda
# Process batch of items with probabilistic retry logic
def process_batch_fuzzily(items):
    ~maybe_for item in items:
        ~kinda_repeat(3):  # Try approximately 3 times
            if process_item(item):
                break
            ~sometimes_while not item.processed:
                retry_with_backoff(item)
```

#### Example 2: Probabilistic System Monitoring  
```kinda
# System health monitoring with fuzzy intervals
def monitor_system_health():
    ~eventually_until system.is_stable():
        collect_metrics()
        ~sometimes_while metrics.show_instability():
            apply_corrective_action()
            ~kinda_repeat(5):
                verify_system_state()
```

#### Example 3: Fuzzy Load Testing
```kinda
# Load testing with probabilistic user behavior simulation
def simulate_user_load():
    ~kinda_repeat(100):  # Approximately 100 users
        user = create_virtual_user()
        ~maybe_for action in user.action_sequence:
            ~sometimes_while action.should_continue():
                execute_action(action)
                ~eventually_until action.is_complete():
                    process_action_result()
```

#### Example 4: Probabilistic Data Processing Pipeline
```kinda
# ETL pipeline with fuzzy error recovery
def process_data_pipeline(data_chunks):
    ~maybe_for chunk in data_chunks:
        ~eventually_until chunk.is_processed():
            try:
                transform_data(chunk)
            except DataError:
                ~kinda_repeat(2):  # Retry approximately twice
                    apply_data_recovery(chunk)
```

### 3. Integration Examples with Epic #124

#### Demonstrating Cross-Epic Synergy
```kinda
# Show how Epic #124 construct composition works with Epic #125 control flow
def demonstrate_complete_probabilistic_programming():
    # Use Epic #124's ~sorta (built from ~sometimes + ~maybe)
    ~sorta initialize_fuzzy_system():
        
        # Use Epic #125 probabilistic control flow
        ~maybe_for component in system.components:
            ~kinda_repeat(3):
                ~sorta setup_component(component)
                
                ~eventually_until component.is_ready():
                    ~sometimes_while component.needs_configuration():
                        apply_fuzzy_config(component)
```

### 4. Performance Characteristics Documentation

#### Performance Comparison Tables
```markdown
| Construct | Standard Loop Overhead | Memory Usage | Best Use Case |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------|---------------|
| ~sometimes_while | +15% | Constant | Fuzzy condition loops |
| ~maybe_for | +10% | O(1) per iteration | Probabilistic batch processing |
| ~kinda_repeat(n) | +5% | Constant | Approximate repetitions |
| ~eventually_until | +20% | Bounded (max 100 evals) | Statistical termination |
```

#### Performance Optimization Guide
- When to use each construct for optimal performance
- Memory considerations for long-running loops
- Nested construct performance implications
- Cross-platform performance variations

### 5. Migration and Upgrade Guide

#### Converting Standard Loops to Probabilistic
```markdown
## Migration Patterns

### Standard while → ~sometimes_while
```python
# Before (standard Python)
while condition:
    action()

# After (kinda-lang)
~sometimes_while condition:
    action()
```

### Standard for → ~maybe_for  
```python
# Before
for item in items:
    process(item)

# After  
~maybe_for item in items:
    process(item)
```
```
