# Epic #125 - Task 2: Repetition Constructs

## üéØ Epic Context
**Epic #125: Probabilistic Control Flow Constructs** - Complete the fuzzy programming paradigm by adding probabilistic control over program flow structures.

## üìã Task Overview
Implement `~kinda_repeat(n)` and `~eventually_until` constructs to provide fuzzy repetition counts and probabilistic termination conditions.

## üîß Technical Requirements

### 1. `~kinda_repeat(n)` - Fuzzy Repetition Counts

#### Core Behavior
```kinda
~kinda_repeat(5):
    action()
    # Executes approximately n times with personality-based variance
    # Actual repetitions: n ¬± personality-based variance
```

#### Implementation Specifications
- **Base Logic**: Repeat block approximately n times with fuzzy variance
- **Personality Integration**:
  - `reliable`: ¬±10% variance (n=5 ‚Üí 4-6 repetitions, usually 5)
  - `cautious`: ¬±20% variance (n=5 ‚Üí 4-6 repetitions, tends toward lower bound)
  - `playful`: ¬±30% variance (n=5 ‚Üí 3-7 repetitions, unpredictable)
  - `chaotic`: ¬±40% variance (n=5 ‚Üí 3-7 repetitions, extreme variance)
- **Distribution**: Uses normal distribution centered on n with personality-based standard deviation
- **Minimum Bound**: Always executes at least 1 time (unless n=0)

#### Test Requirements
```kinda
# Test cases to implement
def test_kinda_repeat_reliable():
    count = 0
    ~kinda_repeat(10):
        count += 1
    # With reliable personality, count should be 9-11, usually 10

def test_kinda_repeat_chaotic():
    count = 0  
    ~kinda_repeat(10):
        count += 1
    # With chaotic personality, count should be 6-14, highly variable
```

### 2. `~eventually_until` - Probabilistic Termination

#### Core Behavior
```kinda
~eventually_until condition:
    action()
    # Loop continues until condition becomes "statistically true"
    # Termination based on probability accumulation over time
```

#### Implementation Specifications
- **Base Logic**: Loop continues until condition meets statistical significance threshold
- **Statistical Framework**: Integrates with existing `~assert_eventually()` framework
- **Termination Logic**:
  - Tracks condition evaluation history over iterations
  - Uses Wilson score interval for confidence calculation
  - Terminates when condition confidence exceeds personality threshold
- **Personality Integration**:
  - `reliable`: 95% confidence threshold (very certain before terminating)
  - `cautious`: 90% confidence threshold (quite certain)  
  - `playful`: 80% confidence threshold (moderately certain)
  - `chaotic`: 70% confidence threshold (somewhat certain)

#### Statistical Implementation
```python
# Core termination logic (simplified)
class EventuallyUntilEvaluator:
    def __init__(self, personality):
        self.confidence_threshold = {
            'reliable': 0.95,
            'cautious': 0.90,
            'playful': 0.80,
            'chaotic': 0.70
        }[personality]
        self.evaluations = []
    
    def should_terminate(self, condition_result):
        self.evaluations.append(condition_result)
        if len(self.evaluations) < 3:
            return False  # Need minimum sample size
        
        # Calculate Wilson score confidence interval
        confidence = self.wilson_score_confidence()
        return confidence > self.confidence_threshold
```

#### Test Requirements
```kinda
# Test cases to implement
def test_eventually_until_reliable():
    count = 0
    ~eventually_until count > 10:
        count += random_increment()  # Fuzzy increment
    # Should terminate when statistically confident count > 10 (95% confidence)

def test_eventually_until_chaotic():
    count = 0
    ~eventually_until count > 10:
        count += random_increment()  # Fuzzy increment  
    # Should terminate earlier with lower confidence (70% confidence)
```
