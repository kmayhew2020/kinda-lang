# Epic #125 - Task 1: Core Loop Constructs

## 🎯 Epic Context
**Epic #125: Probabilistic Control Flow Constructs** - Complete the fuzzy programming paradigm by adding probabilistic control over program flow structures.

## 📋 Task Overview
Implement `~sometimes_while` and `~maybe_for` constructs to provide probabilistic loop continuation and collection iteration capabilities.

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### 1. `~sometimes_while` - Probabilistic Loop Continuation

#### Core Behavior
```kinda
~sometimes_while condition:
    action()
    # Loop continues with probability-based decision at each iteration
    # Condition must still be true for continuation consideration
```

#### Implementation Specifications
- **Base Logic**: Traditional while loop with probabilistic continuation decision
- **Personality Integration**: 
  - `reliable`: 90% continuation probability when condition is true
  - `cautious`: 75% continuation probability  
  - `playful`: 60% continuation probability
  - `chaotic`: 40% continuation probability
- **Condition Evaluation**: Standard boolean condition check before probability assessment
- **Termination**: Loop exits when either condition becomes false OR probability check fails

#### Test Requirements
```kinda
# Test cases to implement
def test_sometimes_while_reliable():
    count = 0
    ~sometimes_while count < 10:
        count += 1
    # With reliable personality, should execute ~9 iterations on average

def test_sometimes_while_chaotic():
    count = 0
    ~sometimes_while count < 10:
        count += 1
    # With chaotic personality, should execute ~4 iterations on average
```

### 2. `~maybe_for` - Probabilistic Collection Iteration

#### Core Behavior  
```kinda
~maybe_for item in collection:
    process(item)
    # Each iteration has personality-based probability of execution
    # Some items may be "kinda skipped"
```

#### Implementation Specifications
- **Base Logic**: Standard for loop with per-iteration execution probability
- **Personality Integration**:
  - `reliable`: 95% execution probability per item
  - `cautious`: 85% execution probability per item  
  - `playful`: 70% execution probability per item
  - `chaotic`: 50% execution probability per item
- **Iteration Order**: Maintains original collection order, probabilistic execution only
- **Item Access**: Skipped items are not processed but iteration continues

#### Test Requirements
```kinda
# Test cases to implement  
def test_maybe_for_reliable():
    processed = []
    items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ~maybe_for item in items:
        processed.append(item)
    # With reliable personality, should process ~4.75 items on average

def test_maybe_for_chaotic():
    processed = []
    items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
    ~maybe_for item in items:
        processed.append(item)
    # With chaotic personality, should process ~2.5 items on average
```

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
