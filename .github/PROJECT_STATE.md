### **Key Objectives for Epic #124**
1. **Demonstrate "Kinda builds Kinda"**: Show higher-level constructs built from basic ones
2. **Construct Composition**: Prove language primitives are sufficient for complex behaviors
3. **Meta-programming Validation**: ~sorta from ~sometimes+~maybe, ~ish from ~kinda float+tolerance
4. **Framework Development**: Infrastructure for future construct compositions

### **Key Objectives for Epic #125**
1. **Complete Probabilistic Programming**: Add missing probabilistic control flow constructs
2. **Address User Feedback Gap**: Implement highest priority missing language features
3. **4 Core Constructs**: ~sometimes_while, ~maybe_for, ~kinda_repeat(n), ~eventually_until
4. **Statistical Integration**: Leverage existing ~assert_eventually() framework for robust termination logic
## üìä Development Status
