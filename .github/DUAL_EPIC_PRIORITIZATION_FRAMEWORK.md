# Dual Epic Prioritization Framework

## üéØ Framework Overview

**Purpose**: Provide clear decision-making guidelines for managing competing priorities between Epic #124 (Construct Self-definition) and Epic #125 (Probabilistic Control Flow Constructs) during parallel development.

**Context**: v0.5.0 "Complete Probabilistic Programming" requires balancing two high-priority epics with shared resources and dependencies.

## üìä Priority Matrix

### Epic-Level Priorities

| Priority Level | Epic #124 | Epic #125 | Rationale |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Strategic** | HIGH | HIGH | Both epics essential for v0.5.0 vision |
| **User Impact** | HIGH | **CRITICAL** | Epic #125 addresses highest priority user feedback gap |
| **Technical Risk** | MEDIUM | HIGH | Epic #125 has more complex statistical requirements |
| **Dependency** | LOW | MEDIUM | Epic #125 depends more on shared infrastructure |

### Task-Level Priority Framework

#### Week 1-3 (Foundation Phase)
**Priority Order**:
1. **Epic #125 Task 1** (Core Loop Constructs) - Addresses critical user gap
2. **Epic #124 Task 1** (Core ~sorta Implementation) - Parallel development
3. **Shared Infrastructure** - Personality integration patterns

**Justification**: Epic #125 addresses the highest priority user feedback gap (probabilistic control flow), while Epic #124 can proceed in parallel using established patterns.

#### Week 4-6 (Framework Phase)
**Priority Order**:
1. **Epic #124 Task 2** (Composition Framework) - Foundation for future development
2. **Epic #125 Task 2** (Repetition Constructs) - Builds on Task 1 infrastructure
3. **Cross-Epic Integration Planning** - Prepare for advanced integration

**Justification**: Epic #124's composition framework becomes critical for long-term language development, while Epic #125 can build incrementally on established patterns.

#### Week 7-8 (Advanced Phase)
**Priority Order**:
1. **Epic #125 Task 3** (Integration & Optimization) - Performance is critical for control flow
2. **Epic #124 Task 3** (~ish Patterns) - Uses established framework from Task 2
3. **Cross-Epic Compatibility** - Ensure seamless integration

**Justification**: Performance optimization for probabilistic control flow is more complex and critical than pattern implementation for construct composition.

#### Week 9 (Documentation Phase)
**Priority Order**:
1. **Cross-Epic Integration Examples** - Demonstrate synergy between epics
2. **Epic #125 Task 4** (Real-world Examples) - Address user practical needs
3. **Epic #124 Task 4** (Composition Documentation) - Complete framework documentation

**Justification**: Combined examples show complete probabilistic programming vision, with practical applications taking priority over theoretical documentation.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Resource Allocation Decision Framework

### When Resources Are Constrained

#### Scenario 1: Technical Bottleneck
**Situation**: Shared infrastructure (personality system, statistical framework) becomes bottleneck
**Decision Framework**:
1. **Identify Impact**: Which epic is more affected by the bottleneck?
2. **User Priority**: Epic #125 gets priority for user-critical features
3. **Alternative Paths**: Can Epic #124 proceed with simplified integration?
4. **Timeline Impact**: Minimize overall v0.5.0 delay

**Example Decision**:
```
Bottleneck: Personality system integration complexity
Impact: Both epics need personality integration
Decision: Simplify Epic #124 personality patterns, prioritize Epic #125 full integration
Rationale: Epic #125 addresses critical user gap, Epic #124 can use basic patterns initially
```

#### Scenario 2: Timeline Pressure
**Situation**: One epic falls behind schedule, threatening v0.5.0 release
**Decision Framework**:
1. **Critical Path Analysis**: Which epic is more essential for v0.5.0?
2. **Feature Reduction**: Can features be moved to v0.6.0?
3. **Resource Reallocation**: Can resources shift temporarily?
4. **Quality Maintenance**: Maintain quality standards while accelerating delivery

**Example Decision**:
```
Situation: Epic #124 Task 2 (Composition Framework) delayed by 1 week
Impact: Affects Epic #124 Tasks 3 & 4 timeline
Decision: Reduce Epic #124 Task 3 scope, reallocate documentation resources
Rationale: Epic #125 completion is more critical for user needs, maintain v0.5.0 timeline
```

### Quality vs Speed Tradeoffs

#### Quality Standards (Non-Negotiable)
- **100% Backward Compatibility**: Both epics must maintain existing functionality
- **Cross-Platform Support**: All constructs work on Windows/macOS/Linux
- **Statistical Accuracy**: Epic #125 statistical termination must be mathematically sound
- **Performance Standards**: Combined overhead <20% for both epics

#### Speed Optimizations (When Necessary)
- **Feature Scope**: Reduce advanced features, focus on core functionality
- **Documentation Depth**: Comprehensive examples vs exhaustive reference documentation
- **Integration Complexity**: Basic integration vs advanced cross-epic patterns
- **Optimization Level**: Functional implementation vs performance-optimized implementation
