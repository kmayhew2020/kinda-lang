# Dual Epic Coordination Strategy

## üéØ Strategic Overview

**Context**: v0.5.0 "Complete Probabilistic Programming" implements parallel development of Epic #124 (Construct Self-definition) and Epic #125 (Probabilistic Control Flow Constructs) based on Architect Agent's comprehensive analysis.

**Rationale**: User feedback analysis (8.5/10 score) revealed probabilistic control flow as the **highest priority gap**, while Epic #124 addresses the core "Kinda builds Kinda" vision. Parallel development maximizes v0.5.0 value delivery.

## üèóÔ∏è Resource Allocation Strategy

### Development Stream Organization

#### Stream A: Epic #124 (Construct Self-definition)
- **Focus**: "How to build constructs" - Framework and composition patterns
- **Architect Agent**: Primary technical architect for composition framework design
- **Coder Agent**: Implementation of construct composition patterns
- **Timeline**: 9 weeks (parallel with Stream B)

#### Stream B: Epic #125 (Probabilistic Control Flow)  
- **Focus**: "What constructs to build" - Missing probabilistic control flow
- **Architect Agent**: Technical design for statistical algorithms and performance optimization
- **Coder Agent**: Implementation of 4 new probabilistic constructs
- **Timeline**: 9 weeks (parallel with Stream A)

### Shared Infrastructure
- **Project Manager Agent**: Cross-epic coordination and milestone tracking
- **Statistical Testing Framework**: Existing `~assert_eventually()` used by both epics
- **Personality System**: Both epics integrate with existing 4-personality system
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Unified testing and deployment for both epics
- **Documentation Infrastructure**: Combined documentation for v0.5.0 release

## ü§ù Coordination Mechanisms

### Weekly Sync Meetings
**Schedule**: Every Tuesday, 10:00 AM
**Participants**: Project Manager, Architect Agents (both epics), Lead Coder Agents
**Agenda Template**:
1. Progress updates from both streams
2. Dependency identification and resolution
3. Integration milestone planning
4. Risk assessment and mitigation
5. Resource allocation adjustments

### Shared Decision Framework
**Infrastructure Decisions**: Joint Architect Agent consultation required
**Performance Standards**: Unified <20% overhead target for both epics  
**Documentation Standards**: Consistent formatting and style across both epics
**Testing Standards**: Both epics use `~assert_eventually()` for statistical validation

### Communication Channels
- **Epic #124 Issues**: Tagged with `epic-124`, `parallel-epic-125` for coordination visibility
- **Epic #125 Issues**: Tagged with `epic-125`, `parallel-epic-124` for coordination visibility  
- **Cross-epic Issues**: Tagged with both epic labels for shared concerns
- **Weekly Status**: Update PROJECT_STATE.md with both epic progress

## ‚ö° Dependency Management

### Shared Dependencies
1. **Personality System**: Both epics integrate with existing 4-personality system
   - Resolution: Establish personality integration patterns in Week 1
   - Owner: Architect Agent (coordination between both epics)

2. **Statistical Testing Framework**: Both epics use `~assert_eventually()`
   - Resolution: Epic #125 leverages existing framework, Epic #124 uses for validation
   - Owner: Epic #125 technical lead (primary user of statistical features)

3. **Performance Infrastructure**: Both epics target <20% overhead
   - Resolution: Shared benchmarking and optimization strategies
   - Owner: Joint Architect Agent consultation

### Cross-Epic Dependencies
- **Epic #124 ‚Üí Epic #125**: Epic #124 composition examples can use Epic #125 constructs
- **Epic #125 ‚Üí Epic #124**: Epic #125 statistical framework can validate Epic #124 compositions
- **Resolution**: Coordinate example development in Week 9 documentation phase

### Conflict Resolution
**Technical Conflicts**: Joint Architect Agent decision with Project Manager arbitration
**Resource Conflicts**: Project Manager reallocation with epic priority consideration
**Timeline Conflicts**: Flexible milestone adjustment with v0.5.0 target preservation

## üö® Risk Management

### Technical Risks

#### Performance Overhead Accumulation
- **Risk**: Combined epic overhead exceeds 20% target
- **Mitigation**: Weekly performance monitoring, shared optimization strategies
- **Contingency**: Priority-based feature reduction if necessary

#### Integration Complexity
- **Risk**: Epic #124 and Epic #125 constructs interact unexpectedly
- **Mitigation**: Cross-epic integration testing starting Week 7
- **Contingency**: Simplified integration patterns if complex interactions emerge

### Timeline Risks

#### Parallel Development Synchronization
- **Risk**: Epic timelines drift out of sync, impacting v0.5.0 release
- **Mitigation**: Weekly sync meetings and milestone tracking
- **Contingency**: Flexible task reallocation between streams

#### Dependency Bottlenecks  
- **Risk**: Shared infrastructure development blocks both epics
- **Mitigation**: Early infrastructure decisions and clear ownership
- **Contingency**: Independent implementation paths for both epics

### Quality Risks

#### Test Coverage Gaps
- **Risk**: Cross-epic functionality inadequately tested
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive integration testing in Week 7-8
- **Contingency**: Extended testing phase if integration issues discovered

#### Documentation Inconsistency
- **Risk**: Epic #124 and Epic #125 documentation styles diverge
- **Mitigation**: Unified documentation standards and Week 9 integration phase
- **Contingency**: Documentation standardization pass before release

## üéâ Success Vision

**v0.5.0 "Complete Probabilistic Programming" delivers**:

1. **Epic #124**: Demonstrates "Kinda builds Kinda" with construct composition framework
2. **Epic #125**: Completes probabilistic programming paradigm with control flow constructs  
3. **Combined Impact**: Users can both compose existing constructs AND use comprehensive probabilistic control flow
4. **Strategic Achievement**: Addresses both user vision ("self-hosting") and practical gaps (control flow)

**Result**: Kinda-lang becomes a genuinely useful tool for probabilistic programming with both theoretical elegance (composition) and practical completeness (full construct coverage).
