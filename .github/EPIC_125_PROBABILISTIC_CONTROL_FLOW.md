# Epic #125: Probabilistic Control Flow Constructs

## 🎯 Epic Overview
**Priority**: HIGH (User Feedback-Driven)  
**Target**: v0.5.0 "Complete Probabilistic Programming"  
**Strategic Context**: Parallel development with Epic #124 (Construct Self-definition)

## 📊 Background & User Feedback Analysis
Based on comprehensive user feedback analysis for v0.4.0 (8.5/10 score), **probabilistic control flow** emerged as the **highest priority gap** in current language capabilities.

### Critical User Insights:
- Current constructs handle **individual statements** well (`~sometimes print`, `~maybe x = 5`)
- **Missing**: Probabilistic control over **program flow structures** (loops, iterations, repetitions)
- **Gap**: No way to express "kinda loop", "maybe iterate", "sorta repeat" patterns
- **Impact**: Limits language expressiveness for real-world fuzzy programming scenarios

## 🚀 Epic Objectives

### Primary Goal: Complete Probabilistic Programming Paradigm
Add probabilistic control flow constructs to complement existing probabilistic statements, achieving **complete coverage** of programming constructs with fuzziness.

### Strategic Alignment
- **Epic #124 Focus**: How to build constructs (composition framework)
- **Epic #125 Focus**: What constructs to build (probabilistic control flow)
- **Combined Impact**: Complete "genuine utility" vision for fuzzy programming

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Constructs to Implement

#### 1. `~sometimes_while` - Probabilistic Loop Continuation
```kinda
~sometimes_while condition:
    # Loop body executes with probability-based continuation decisions
    action()
    # Personality affects continuation probability
```

**Behavior**:
- Standard `while` loop with probabilistic continuation at each iteration
- Personality-influenced probability thresholds (reliable=90%, chaotic=40%)
- Condition still must be true for continuation consideration

#### 2. `~maybe_for` - Probabilistic Collection Iteration  
```kinda
~maybe_for item in collection:
    # Each iteration has probability of execution
    process(item)
    # Some items may be "kinda skipped"
```

**Behavior**:
- Iterates through collection with probabilistic execution per item
- Maintains iteration order but allows probabilistic skipping
- Personality affects skip probability (reliable=10%, chaotic=60%)

#### 3. `~kinda_repeat(n)` - Fuzzy Repetition Counts
```kinda
~kinda_repeat(5):
    # Executes approximately n times with fuzzy variance
    action()
    # Actual repetitions: n ± personality-based variance
```

**Behavior**:
- Target repetition count with personality-based variance
- Reliable personality: ±10% variance, Chaotic: ±40% variance
- Maintains probabilistic "around n times" semantics

#### 4. `~eventually_until` - Probabilistic Termination
```kinda
~eventually_until condition:
    # Loop continues until condition becomes "statistically true"
    action()
    # Termination based on probability accumulation
```

**Behavior**:
- Loop continues until condition meets statistical significance threshold
- Uses Wilson score interval for robust probability assessment
- Integrates with existing `~assert_eventually()` statistical framework
