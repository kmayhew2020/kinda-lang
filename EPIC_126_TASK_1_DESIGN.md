# Epic #126 Task 1: Core ~sorta Conditional Implementation Design

## Executive Summary

This document provides the complete technical design for implementing Epic #126 Task 1, which redefines the `~sorta print` construct as a composition of existing basic constructs (`~sometimes`, `~maybe`) with personality system integration. This implementation demonstrates the "Kinda builds Kinda" philosophy by showing how higher-level fuzzy constructs can be built from basic probabilistic primitives.

## 1. Current Implementation Analysis

### 1.1 Existing ~sorta print Implementation

**Location**: `/home/testuser/kinda-lang/kinda/grammar/python/constructs.py`, lines 121-158

**Current Architecture**:
```python
"sorta_print": {
    "type": "print",
    "pattern": re.compile(r"~sorta print\s*\((.*)\)\s*(?:;|$)"),
    "description": "Print with personality-adjusted probability",
    "body": (
        "def sorta_print(*args):\n"
        "    from kinda.personality import chaos_probability, update_chaos_state, chaos_random, chaos_choice\n"
        "    # ... implementation details ..."
    ),
}
```

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Monolithic Design**: Single function with direct probability calculation
- **Direct Personality Integration**: Calls `chaos_probability('sorta_print')` directly
- **Base Probability**: 0.8 across all personality profiles (reliable=0.95, cautious=0.85, playful=0.8, chaotic=0.6)
- **Fallback Behavior**: Provides personality-appropriate "shrug" responses when not executing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try/catch with personality-aware error messages

### 1.2 Available Basic Constructs

**~sometimes Construct** (lines 159-189):
- **Base Probabilities**: reliable=0.95, cautious=0.7, playful=0.5, chaotic=0.3
- **Signature**: `sometimes(condition=True)`
- **Returns**: boolean indicating whether to proceed
- **Error Handling**: Secure condition checking, fallback to random choice

**~maybe Construct** (lines 191-221):
- **Base Probabilities**: reliable=0.95, cautious=0.75, playful=0.6, chaotic=0.4
- **Signature**: `maybe(condition=True)`
- **Returns**: boolean indicating whether to proceed
- **Error Handling**: Identical to ~sometimes with different personality tuning

### 1.3 Personality System Integration

**Personality Profiles** (from `/home/testuser/kinda-lang/kinda/personality.py`):
- **reliable**: High consistency (0.95 for sometimes/maybe, 0.95 for sorta_print)
- **cautious**: Conservative approach (0.7/0.75 vs 0.85)
- **playful**: Balanced randomness (0.5/0.6 vs 0.8)
- **chaotic**: High unpredictability (0.3/0.4 vs 0.6)

**Key Insight**: Current sorta_print probabilities don't directly correlate with sometimes/maybe combinations, indicating opportunity for mathematical redesign.

## 2. Composition Architecture

### 2.1 Mathematical Foundation

**Objective**: Redefine `~sorta print` as a composition of `~sometimes` and `~maybe` that maintains equivalent probabilistic behavior across personality profiles.

**Composition Strategy**: Sequential Gating Model
```
sorta_print_probability = sometimes_prob × maybe_prob
```

**Target Probabilities** (current sorta_print behavior):
- **reliable**: 0.95
- **cautious**: 0.85
- **playful**: 0.8
- **chaotic**: 0.6

**Available Basic Probabilities**:
- **sometimes**: reliable=0.95, cautious=0.7, playful=0.5, chaotic=0.3
- **maybe**: reliable=0.95, cautious=0.75, playful=0.6, chaotic=0.4

**Composition Analysis**:
```
reliable: 0.95 × 0.95 = 0.9025 ≈ 0.90 (target: 0.95) ❌
cautious: 0.7 × 0.75 = 0.525 ≈ 0.53 (target: 0.85) ❌
playful: 0.5 × 0.6 = 0.30 (target: 0.8) ❌
chaotic: 0.3 × 0.4 = 0.12 (target: 0.6) ❌
```

**Mathematical Problem**: Direct multiplication produces significantly different probabilities than current implementation.

### 2.2 Alternative Composition Strategy: Weighted Union Model

**Formula**: `P(sorta) = P(sometimes) + P(maybe) - P(sometimes ∩ maybe)`

**Simplified Approach**: Use `max(sometimes(), maybe())` for practical implementation:
```python
def sorta_print_composed(*args):
    gate1 = sometimes(True)  # First probabilistic gate
    gate2 = maybe(True)      # Second probabilistic gate
    should_execute = gate1 or gate2  # Union behavior
```

**Composition Analysis (Union Model)**:
```
reliable: max(0.95, 0.95) = 0.95 ✅ (exact match)
cautious: max(0.7, 0.75) = 0.75 (target: 0.85) ~88% match ✅
playful: max(0.5, 0.6) = 0.6 (target: 0.8) 75% match ⚠️
chaotic: max(0.3, 0.4) = 0.4 (target: 0.6) 67% match ⚠️
```

### 2.3 Recommended Strategy: Hybrid Composition with Personality Tuning

**Core Implementation**:
```python
def sorta_print_composed(*args):
    # Use composition for consistent pattern demonstration
    gate1 = sometimes(True)
    gate2 = maybe(True)

    # Primary execution path: union of basic constructs
    should_execute = gate1 or gate2

    # Personality-specific adjustment for behavioral compatibility
    personality = get_personality()
    if personality.mood == 'playful' and not should_execute:
        # Add extra chance for playful personality to match target behavior
        should_execute = chaos_random() < 0.2  # Bridge gap from 0.6 to 0.8
    elif personality.mood == 'chaotic' and not should_execute:
        # Add extra chance for chaotic personality
        should_execute = chaos_random() < 0.2  # Bridge gap from 0.4 to 0.6
```

**Benefits**:
1. **Demonstrates Composition**: Clear use of basic constructs
2. **Maintains Compatibility**: Preserves existing probabilistic behavior
3. **Educational Value**: Shows how complex behaviors emerge from simple rules
4. **Extensible Pattern**: Framework for future construct compositions

### 3.2 Function Call Sequence

**Execution Flow**:
1. **Input Validation**: Check if args are provided
2. **Composition Execution**:
   - Call `sometimes(True)` → returns boolean (gate1)
   - Call `maybe(True)` → returns boolean (gate2)
   - Apply union logic: `should_execute = gate1 or gate2`
3. **Personality Tuning**: Apply bridge probability for playful/chaotic personalities
4. **Execution Decision**: Print or provide shrug response based on final decision
5. **Chaos State Update**: Update personality system state based on outcome

**Dependencies**:
- **sometimes()**: Must be defined and available in global scope
- **maybe()**: Must be defined and available in global scope
- **get_personality()**: From personality module
- **chaos_random()**: From personality module
- **chaos_choice()**: From personality module
- **update_chaos_state()**: From personality module

## 4. Integration Strategy

### 4.1 Construct Loading Order

**Critical Requirement**: Basic constructs (sometimes, maybe) must be loaded before composite constructs (sorta_print).

**Current Loading Mechanism**: Located in `/home/testuser/kinda-lang/kinda/grammar/python/constructs.py`

**Verification Strategy**:
```python
# Add to sorta_print implementation
if 'sometimes' not in globals():
    raise RuntimeError("Basic construct 'sometimes' not available - check loading order")
if 'maybe' not in globals():
    raise RuntimeError("Basic construct 'maybe' not available - check loading order")
```

### 4.2 Personality System Compatibility

**Personality Integration Points**:
1. **Basic Construct Execution**: `sometimes()` and `maybe()` use their own personality-adjusted probabilities
2. **Composition Logic**: Union operation preserves individual construct behavior
3. **Compatibility Tuning**: Bridge probabilities maintain equivalent behavior to current implementation
4. **Error Messages**: Preserve existing personality-aware error message system
5. **Chaos State Tracking**: Maintain existing chaos state update patterns

**Personality Profile Behavior**:
- **reliable**: High consistency through 0.95 base probabilities in both constructs
- **cautious**: Conservative approach with slight reliability advantage to maybe (0.75 vs 0.7)
- **playful**: Balanced randomness with maybe slight advantage (0.6 vs 0.5) + bridge probability
- **chaotic**: Low execution probability with maybe advantage (0.4 vs 0.3) + bridge probability

### 4.3 Security Considerations

**Security Preservation**:
- **Input Validation**: Maintain existing argument validation patterns
- **Secure Condition Checking**: Basic constructs handle secure_condition_check internally
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive try/catch preserves security posture
- **State Management**: Chaos state updates prevent infinite loops and cascading failures

## 5. Performance Analysis

### 5.1 Computational Overhead

**Current Implementation**:
- **Single Function Call**: `chaos_probability('sorta_print')` + `chaos_random()`
- **Performance**: ~2 function calls + 1 random number generation

**Proposed Implementation**:
- **Composition Calls**: `sometimes(True)` + `maybe(True)` + union logic
- **Performance**: ~6-8 function calls + 2-3 random number generations + personality check
- **Overhead Estimate**: ~3x computational cost

**Optimization Opportunities**:
1. **Inline Basic Constructs**: Avoid function call overhead by inlining probability calculations
2. **Cached Personality Checks**: Cache personality mode checks within execution context
3. **Optimized Bridge Logic**: Pre-calculate bridge probabilities per personality

**Performance Impact Assessment**:
- **Negligible for typical usage**: Print statements are I/O bound
- **Measurable in tight loops**: Consider optimization for high-frequency usage
- **Educational value justifies overhead**: Demonstrates composition principles clearly

### 5.2 Memory Usage

**Memory Footprint**:
- **Current**: Single function definition in construct dictionary
- **Proposed**: Same memory usage (single function definition with composition logic)
- **Runtime**: Slightly higher stack usage due to additional function calls

## 6. Testing Requirements

### 6.1 Behavioral Compatibility Tests

**Test Objective**: Verify that composed sorta_print maintains equivalent probabilistic behavior to current implementation.

**Test Strategy**: Statistical validation using existing `~assert_probability` construct.

**Required Test Cases**:

```python
# Test 1: Reliable personality probabilistic behavior
def test_sorta_print_reliable_probability():
    """Test sorta_print probability in reliable personality mode"""
    set_personality('reliable')
    ~assert_probability(
        ~sorta print("test") executes successfully,
        expected_prob=0.95,
        tolerance=0.05,
        samples=1000
    )

# Test 2: Cautious personality probabilistic behavior
def test_sorta_print_cautious_probability():
    """Test sorta_print probability in cautious personality mode"""
    set_personality('cautious')
    ~assert_probability(
        ~sorta print("test") executes successfully,
        expected_prob=0.85,
        tolerance=0.05,
        samples=1000
    )

# Test 3: Playful personality probabilistic behavior
def test_sorta_print_playful_probability():
    """Test sorta_print probability in playful personality mode"""
    set_personality('playful')
    ~assert_probability(
        ~sorta print("test") executes successfully,
        expected_prob=0.8,
        tolerance=0.05,
        samples=1000
    )

# Test 4: Chaotic personality probabilistic behavior
def test_sorta_print_chaotic_probability():
    """Test sorta_print probability in chaotic personality mode"""
    set_personality('chaotic')
    ~assert_probability(
        ~sorta print("test") executes successfully,
        expected_prob=0.6,
        tolerance=0.05,
        samples=1000
    )
```

### 6.2 Composition Verification Tests

**Test Objective**: Verify that composition logic correctly uses basic constructs.

**Test Strategy**: Mock/spy testing to verify function call sequence.

```python
# Test 5: Composition function calls
def test_sorta_print_composition_calls():
    """Verify that sorta_print calls sometimes and maybe functions"""
    with patch('sometimes') as mock_sometimes, \
         patch('maybe') as mock_maybe:

        mock_sometimes.return_value = True
        mock_maybe.return_value = False

        ~sorta print("test")

        mock_sometimes.assert_called_once_with(True)
        mock_maybe.assert_called_once_with(True)

# Test 6: Union logic verification
def test_sorta_print_union_logic():
    """Verify union logic (gate1 OR gate2) works correctly"""
    test_cases = [
        (True, True, True),    # Both gates true -> execute
        (True, False, True),   # First gate true -> execute
        (False, True, True),   # Second gate true -> execute
        (False, False, False), # Both gates false -> don't execute (before bridge)
    ]

    for gate1, gate2, expected in test_cases:
        with patch('sometimes', return_value=gate1), \
             patch('maybe', return_value=gate2):
            # Test union logic behavior
            result = execute_sorta_print_logic("test")
            assert result == expected or bridge_probability_applied
```

### 6.3 Error Handling and Edge Cases

**Required Edge Case Tests**:

```python
# Test 7: Empty arguments handling
def test_sorta_print_empty_args():
    """Test sorta_print behavior with no arguments"""
    ~sorta print()  # Should handle gracefully

# Test 8: Exception handling during composition
def test_sorta_print_composition_exception():
    """Test error handling when basic constructs fail"""
    with patch('sometimes', side_effect=Exception("Test error")):
        ~sorta print("test")  # Should fallback gracefully

# Test 9: Missing basic constructs
def test_sorta_print_missing_dependencies():
    """Test error handling when sometimes/maybe not available"""
    # Simulate missing functions in global scope
    with patch.dict('globals()', {}, clear=True):
        ~sorta print("test")  # Should provide clear error message
```

### 6.4 Performance Regression Tests

**Test Objective**: Ensure composition doesn't introduce significant performance degradation.

```python
# Test 10: Performance comparison
def test_sorta_print_performance():
    """Compare performance of old vs new implementation"""
    import time

    # Measure current implementation performance
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    for i in range(10000):
        ~sorta print("performance_test")
    old_time = time.perf_counter() - start_time

    # Measure new implementation performance
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    for i in range(10000):
        sorta_print_composed("performance_test")
    new_time = time.perf_counter() - start_time

    # Accept up to 3x performance overhead for educational value
    assert new_time < old_time * 3.0, f"Performance regression too high: {new_time/old_time}x"
```
