# 📚 Kinda-Lang User Documentation Architecture v0.5.1

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive architecture for Kinda-Lang's user documentation system, designed to address critical documentation quality issues and prepare v0.5.1 for final release. The architecture provides a systematic approach to documentation management, example validation, user experience optimization, and quality assurance.

## 🚨 Critical Issues Addressed

### Primary Issues
- **Issue #86**: Broken installation examples with syntax errors
- **Issue #87**: Missing CI testing for demo files
- **Issue #88**: Incomplete v0.4.0 documentation and feature coverage

### Secondary Quality Issues
- Inconsistent example categorization and discovery
- Lack of progressive learning paths for users
- Missing statistical validation for probabilistic examples
- Poor maintainability of documentation assets

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Core Principles
1. **Quality First**: All documentation must be tested and validated
2. **User-Centric**: Progressive complexity for all skill levels
