# Performance Testing Framework Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive architecture for a CI-stable performance testing framework designed to eliminate the 8 currently skipped or unstable performance tests in the kinda-lang project. The framework addresses timing variability in CI environments, import dependency issues, and provides robust statistical validation for kinda-lang's probabilistic constructs.

## Executive Summary

### Current State Analysis
- **Total Performance Tests**: 13 (7 in documentation, 6 in ish benchmarks)
- **Failed Tests**: 1 (test_cross_platform_performance_consistency)
- **Skipped Tests**: 2 (ish_comparison_performance, ish_value_performance)
- **Unregistered Pytest Marks**: 6 warnings for `@pytest.mark.performance` and `@pytest.mark.slow`
- **Root Causes**:
  1. Hardcoded timing thresholds incompatible with CI variability
  2. Missing ish_composition runtime module causing import failures
  3. Unregistered pytest marks
  4. Flaky cross-platform performance assertions

### Target Architecture Goals
- **100% CI Reliability** across Ubuntu, macOS, Windows
- **Zero Dynamic Skips** through dependency resolution
- **Statistical Robustness** for probabilistic language constructs
- **Performance Regression Detection** with trend monitoring
- **<5% Framework Overhead** for performance measurements

## Component Specifications

### 2.1 Environment Detection System

**Purpose**: Automatically detect and adapt to different execution environments

**Components**:
- **CI Environment Detector**: Identifies GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.
- **Platform Capability Analyzer**: Measures CPU, memory, and I/O characteristics
- **Resource Constraint Monitor**: Tracks system load during test execution

**Key Interfaces**:
```python
class EnvironmentDetector:
    def detect_ci_environment() -> CIEnvironment
    def get_platform_capabilities() -> PlatformProfile
    def monitor_resource_constraints() -> ResourceMetrics
```

**Environment Profiles**:
- **CI Environments**: GitHub Actions (Ubuntu/macOS/Windows), Local Development
- **Capability Metrics**: CPU cores, memory, storage type, network latency
- **Constraint Factors**: Load averages, memory pressure, I/O wait times

### 2.2 Threshold Management System

**Purpose**: Calculate adaptive performance thresholds based on environment and historical data

**Dynamic Baseline Calculator**:
- Maintains historical performance baselines per environment
- Uses rolling averages with decay for adaptation
- Stores baselines in persistent cache (JSON format)

**Statistical Threshold Adapter**:
- Applies statistical methods (confidence intervals, percentiles)
- Adjusts thresholds based on environment constraints
- Implements Chauvenet's criterion for outlier detection

**Regression Detection Engine**:
- Compares current results against historical trends
- Uses Mann-Whitney U test for distribution comparisons
- Triggers alerts for statistically significant regressions

**Key Algorithms**:
```python
# Adaptive threshold calculation
threshold = baseline_median + (environment_factor * baseline_std * confidence_multiplier)

# Regression detection
if mann_whitney_u_test(current_samples, historical_samples).p_value < 0.05:
    trigger_regression_alert()
```

### 2.3 Dependency Resolution System

**Purpose**: Eliminate dynamic test skips through robust dependency management

**Module Availability Checker**:
- Scans for required modules at framework initialization
- Maintains dependency graph with fallback options
- Provides clear error messages for missing dependencies

**Fallback Implementation Provider**:
- Provides mock implementations for missing ish_composition modules
- Maintains behavioral compatibility with expected interfaces
- Ensures tests exercise the same code paths

**Mock Framework Integration**:
- Integrates with unittest.mock for transparent substitution
- Maintains performance characteristics of real implementations
- Provides configurable behavior for different test scenarios

**Missing Module Resolution Strategy**:
```python
# For ish_composition_composed functions
if not ish_composition_available:
    # Provide functionally equivalent mock that exercises same logic
    ish_comparison_composed = create_performance_equivalent_mock(ish_comparison)
```

### 2.4 Data Collection & Analysis

**Performance Metrics Collector**:
- High-precision timing using `time.perf_counter()`
- Memory usage tracking with `psutil`
- CPU utilization monitoring during test execution
- Statistical sampling with configurable iteration counts

**Statistical Analysis Engine**:
- Calculates robust statistics (median, MAD, percentiles)
- Performs normality tests (Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov)
- Applies appropriate statistical tests based on data distribution
- Implements bootstrap resampling for confidence intervals

**Trend Monitoring System**:
- Tracks performance metrics over time
- Detects gradual performance degradation
- Maintains rolling windows of historical data
- Provides visualization data for performance dashboards

### 2.5 CI Integration Layer

**Results Caching System**:
- Stores performance results in structured format (JSON/SQLite)
- Implements cache invalidation based on code changes
- Provides fast access to historical baselines
- Supports distributed caching for multi-runner environments

**Cross-Platform Normalizer**:
- Normalizes performance metrics across different platforms
- Accounts for known platform-specific performance characteristics
- Provides platform-independent performance scoring
- Maintains separate baselines per platform family

**Alerting & Reporting Engine**:
