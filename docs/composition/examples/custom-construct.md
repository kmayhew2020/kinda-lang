# Custom Construct Example: Building Your Own Composition

## üéØ Overview

This tutorial walks you through building a completely new composite construct from scratch using the Kinda-Lang Composition Framework. You'll create `~eventually`, a construct that combines persistence with uncertainty to model "eventually successful" operations.

## üí° Concept: ~eventually Construct

### Design Goals

Create a construct that:
- **Attempts operations multiple times** with increasing probability of success
- **Adapts to personality** (reliable tries fewer times, chaotic tries more)
- **Demonstrates composition** by using ~sometimes, ~maybe, and ~kinda_repeat
- **Shows practical value** for modeling real-world "eventually successful" scenarios

### Behavior Specification

```kinda
// Basic usage
~eventually { print("This will happen... eventually") }

// With explicit attempts
~eventually(max_attempts=5) { risky_operation() }

// Personality-aware behavior:
// - reliable: succeeds quickly (2-3 attempts)
// - cautious: moderate attempts (3-4 attempts)
// - playful: variable attempts (2-6 attempts)
// - chaotic: many attempts (4-8 attempts)
```

## üèóÔ∏è Step 1: Design the Composition Strategy

### Mathematical Model

**Core Logic**: Increasing probability with each attempt
```
attempt_1: base_probability
attempt_2: base_probability * 1.3
attempt_3: base_probability * 1.6
attempt_n: base_probability * (1 + 0.3 * (n-1))
```

**Base Probabilities by Personality**:
- reliable: 0.7 (high initial success chance)
- cautious: 0.5 (moderate initial success chance)
- playful: 0.4 (lower initial success chance)
- chaotic: 0.3 (low initial success chance)

**Maximum Attempts by Personality**:
- reliable: 3 (efficient, quick success)
- cautious: 4 (careful but not excessive)
- playful: 6 (willing to experiment)
- chaotic: 8 (persistent despite failures)

### Component Analysis

**Required Basic Constructs**:
- `~sometimes`: Provides probabilistic execution for each attempt
- `~maybe`: Adds secondary probability layer for attempt decisions
- `~kinda_repeat`: Manages the retry loop structure

## üéØ Step 7: Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
# Simple eventually block
from kinda.langs.python.runtime.fuzzy import eventually

def risky_operation():
    from kinda.personality import chaos_random
    return chaos_random() < 0.3  # 30% chance of success

# Will try multiple times until success
result = eventually(risky_operation)
print(f"Eventually succeeded: {result}")
```

### Advanced Usage

```python
# With custom max attempts
def download_file(url):
    # Simulated download operation
    import random
    if random.random() < 0.4:
        return f"Downloaded {url}"
    else:
        raise Exception("Network error")

try:
    result = eventually(lambda: download_file("https://example.com"), max_attempts=5)
    print(f"Download result: {result}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Download failed after all attempts: {e}")
```

### In Kinda-Lang Syntax (Conceptual)

```kinda
// Basic usage
~eventually {
    risky_api_call()
}

// With parameters
~eventually(max_attempts=3) {
    upload_file("data.txt")
}

// Nested with other constructs
~sometimes {
    ~eventually(max_attempts=5) {
        ~maybe {
            complex_operation()
        }
    }
}
```

## üìä Step 8: Performance Analysis

## üéì What You've Learned

### Composition Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Sequential Strategy**: Multiple attempts in sequence with increasing probability
2. **Personality Integration**: Different behavior patterns per personality mode
3. **Dependency Management**: Systematic validation of required basic constructs
4. **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of operation failures
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Framework overhead within acceptable limits

### Framework Integration Skills

1. **Pattern Registration**: How to register custom patterns with the composition engine
2. **Factory Methods**: Creating convenience functions for pattern creation
3. **Runtime Integration**: Connecting compositions to language runtime
4. **Statistical Validation**: Ensuring composed behavior meets target probabilities
5. **Testing Strategies**: Comprehensive testing across personalities and edge cases

### Advanced Patterns Unlocked

1. **Increasing Probability**: Modeling operations that become more likely to succeed over time
2. **Adaptive Attempts**: Personality-specific retry behavior
3. **Bridge Probabilities**: Fine-tuning final success rates
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Robust error handling with multiple fallback layers
5. **Performance Optimization**: Balancing framework benefits with execution efficiency

## üöÄ Next Steps

Now that you've built a custom composition:

1. **Experiment with variations**: Try different probability calculations or retry strategies
2. **Add more complexity**: Integrate with other composed constructs
3. **Performance optimization**: Implement caching or lazy loading
4. **Real-world application**: Use ~eventually for actual retry scenarios
5. **Study [Advanced Patterns](../advanced-patterns.md)**: Learn sophisticated composition techniques

## üéØ Production Considerations

### Feature Flag Integration

```python
def eventually_with_feature_flag(operation_func=None, max_attempts=None):
    """Production version with feature flag support"""
    import os

    if os.getenv('KINDA_USE_COMPOSITION_EVENTUALLY', 'true').lower() == 'true':
        try:
            return eventually(operation_func, max_attempts)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[eventually] Composition fallback: {e}")
            return simple_retry_fallback(operation_func, max_attempts)
    else:
        return simple_retry_fallback(operation_func, max_attempts)
```

### Monitoring and Metrics

```python
def eventually_with_monitoring(operation_func=None, max_attempts=None):
    """Version with monitoring and metrics collection"""
    import time

    start_time = time.time()
    attempt_count = 0

    def monitored_operation():
        nonlocal attempt_count
        attempt_count += 1
        return operation_func() if operation_func else True

    try:
        result = eventually(monitored_operation, max_attempts)

        # Collect metrics
        execution_time = time.time() - start_time
        success = result

        # Log metrics (in production, send to monitoring system)
        print(f"[metrics] eventually: success={success}, attempts={attempt_count}, "
              f"time={execution_time:.3f}s")

        return result

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[metrics] eventually: error={e}, attempts={attempt_count}")
        raise
```
