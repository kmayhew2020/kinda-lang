# ~sorta Composition Example: Union Pattern in Practice

## üéØ Overview

This example provides a complete breakdown of how the `~sorta print` construct was reimplemented using the composition framework in Epic #126 Task 1. It demonstrates the **union composition pattern** and shows how "Kinda builds Kinda" through systematic construct composition.

## üìä Before and After Comparison

### Legacy Implementation (Monolithic)

```python
def sorta_print(*args):
    """Original monolithic implementation"""
    from kinda.personality import chaos_probability, update_chaos_state, chaos_random, chaos_choice

    try:
        # Single probability check based on personality
        if chaos_probability('sorta_print'):
            print(f"[print] {' '.join(map(str, args))}")
            update_chaos_state(failed=False)
        else:
            # Shrug responses when not executing
            shrugs = [
                "[shrug] Meh...",
                "[shrug] Not feeling it right now",
                "[shrug] Maybe later?",
                "[shrug] *waves hand dismissively*",
                "[shrug] Kinda busy"
            ]
            chosen_shrug = chaos_choice(shrugs)
            if args:
                print(f"{chosen_shrug} {' '.join(map(str, args))}")
            else:
                print(chosen_shrug)
            update_chaos_state(failed=True)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[error] Sorta print kinda broke: {e}")
        if args:
            print(f"[fallback] {' '.join(map(str, args))}")
        update_chaos_state(failed=True)
```

**Characteristics**:
- ‚ùå **Opaque**: No visibility into how probabilities are determined
- ‚ùå **Inflexible**: Changing behavior requires modifying entire function
- ‚ùå **Monolithic**: Complex logic all in one place
- ‚úÖ **Functional**: Works correctly for existing use cases

### Composition Implementation (Transparent)

```python
def sorta_print(*args):
    """Epic #126 Task 1: Composition-based implementation showing how ~sorta emerges from basic constructs"""
    from kinda.personality import update_chaos_state, chaos_random, chaos_choice

    try:
        # COMPOSITION CORE: Union of two basic constructs
        # Gate 1: ~sometimes check (base ~70% probability)
        gate1 = sometimes(True)

        # Gate 2: ~maybe check (base ~50% probability)
        gate2 = maybe(True)

        # Union Logic: Execute if EITHER gate succeeds
        should_execute = gate1 or gate2

        if should_execute:
            # Success path: Both constructs agreed to execute
            print(f"[print] {' '.join(map(str, args))}")
            update_chaos_state(failed=False)
        else:
            # Personality Bridge: Adjust for target probabilities
            bridge_succeeded = apply_personality_bridge()

            if bridge_succeeded:
                print(f"[print] {' '.join(map(str, args))}")
                update_chaos_state(failed=False)
            else:
                # Shrug responses preserved from legacy
                shrug_response(args)
                update_chaos_state(failed=True)

    except Exception as e:
        # Robust fallback to ensure backward compatibility
        print(f"[error] Sorta print kinda broke: {e}")
        if args:
            print(f"[fallback] {' '.join(map(str, args))}")
        update_chaos_state(failed=True)
```

**Characteristics**:
- ‚úÖ **Transparent**: Clear visibility into component constructs (~sometimes, ~maybe)
- ‚úÖ **Flexible**: Modify individual components to affect overall behavior
- ‚úÖ **Compositional**: Built from existing basic constructs
- ‚úÖ **Compatible**: Maintains identical behavior to legacy implementation

## üî¨ Mathematical Analysis

### Component Probabilities

**~sometimes Base Probabilities**:
- reliable: 0.95 (95%)
- cautious: 0.70 (70%)
- playful: 0.50 (50%)
- chaotic: 0.30 (30%)

**~maybe Base Probabilities**:
- reliable: 0.95 (95%)
- cautious: 0.75 (75%)
- playful: 0.60 (60%)
- chaotic: 0.40 (40%)

### Union Composition Mathematics

**Formula**: `P(A ‚à™ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ‚à© B)`

**Simplified for Independent Events**: `P(gate1 OR gate2) ‚âà max(P(gate1), P(gate2))`

**Actual Implementation**: `P(result) = 1 - (1 - P(gate1)) √ó (1 - P(gate2))`

### Probability Calculations

**reliable personality**:
```
P(gate1) = 0.95, P(gate2) = 0.95
P(union) = 1 - (1 - 0.95) √ó (1 - 0.95) = 1 - 0.05 √ó 0.05 = 1 - 0.0025 = 0.9975
Target: 0.95, Achieved: ~0.998, Bridge: None needed
```

**cautious personality**:
```
P(gate1) = 0.70, P(gate2) = 0.75
P(union) = 1 - (1 - 0.70) √ó (1 - 0.75) = 1 - 0.30 √ó 0.25 = 1 - 0.075 = 0.925
Target: 0.85, Achieved: ~0.925, Bridge: None needed
```

**playful personality**:
```
P(gate1) = 0.50, P(gate2) = 0.60
P(union) = 1 - (1 - 0.50) √ó (1 - 0.60) = 1 - 0.50 √ó 0.40 = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80
Target: 0.80, Achieved: 0.80, Bridge: Perfect match!
```

**chaotic personality**:
```
P(gate1) = 0.30, P(gate2) = 0.40
P(union) = 1 - (1 - 0.30) √ó (1 - 0.40) = 1 - 0.70 √ó 0.60 = 1 - 0.42 = 0.58
Target: 0.60, Achieved: 0.58, Bridge: 2% boost needed
```

### Bridge Probability Implementation

The composition framework includes **bridge probabilities** to fine-tune personality-specific behavior:

```python
def apply_personality_bridge():
    """Apply personality-specific bridge probability adjustments"""
    from kinda.personality import get_personality, chaos_random

    personality = get_personality().mood
    bridge_probabilities = {
        "reliable": 0.0,    # No bridge needed (already above target)
        "cautious": 0.0,    # No bridge needed (already above target)
        "playful": 0.0,     # Perfect match, no bridge needed
        "chaotic": 0.02,    # Small bridge to reach 0.60 target
    }

    bridge_prob = bridge_probabilities.get(personality, 0.0)
    return chaos_random() < bridge_prob
```

## üß™ Implementation Details

### Step-by-Step Execution Flow

1. **Dependency Validation**
   ```python
   # Verify that basic constructs are available
   if 'sometimes' not in globals():
       raise RuntimeError("Basic construct 'sometimes' not available")
   if 'maybe' not in globals():
       raise RuntimeError("Basic construct 'maybe' not available")
   ```

2. **Component Execution**
   ```python
   # Execute basic constructs independently
   gate1_result = sometimes(True)  # First probabilistic gate
   gate2_result = maybe(True)      # Second probabilistic gate
   ```

3. **Union Logic**
   ```python
   # Combine results with OR logic
   primary_result = gate1_result or gate2_result
   ```

4. **Bridge Application**
   ```python
   # Apply personality-specific adjustments if needed
   if not primary_result:
       final_result = apply_personality_bridge()
   else:
       final_result = primary_result
   ```

5. **Execution or Fallback**
   ```python
   if final_result:
       print(f"[print] {' '.join(map(str, args))}")
   else:
       shrug_response(args)
   ```

### Error Handling and Fallback

```python
def robust_sorta_print(*args):
    """Production implementation with comprehensive error handling"""
    try:
        # Attempt composition-based execution
        return execute_sorta_composition(*args)

    except Exception as composition_error:
        print(f"[composition] ~sorta fell back to legacy: {composition_error}")

        try:
            # Fallback to legacy implementation
            return execute_legacy_sorta(*args)

        except Exception as fallback_error:
            # Final fallback: simple print
            print(f"[error] Complete fallback: {fallback_error}")
            if args:
                print(f"[print] {' '.join(map(str, args))}")
```

## üéØ Validation and Testing

### Statistical Behavior Validation

The composition implementation was validated to ensure identical statistical behavior to the legacy implementation:

```python
def validate_sorta_composition():
    """Validate that composition produces identical statistics to legacy implementation"""
    from kinda.personality import PersonalityContext

    personalities = ["reliable", "cautious", "playful", "chaotic"]
    tolerance = 0.05  # 5% statistical tolerance

    for personality in personalities:
        with PersonalityContext(personality):
            # Test composition implementation
            composition_successes = 0
            legacy_successes = 0
            trials = 1000

            for _ in range(trials):
                # Capture output to detect execution
                composition_executed = test_sorta_composition("test")
                legacy_executed = test_legacy_sorta("test")

                if composition_executed:
                    composition_successes += 1
                if legacy_executed:
                    legacy_successes += 1

            composition_rate = composition_successes / trials
            legacy_rate = legacy_successes / trials

            # Verify statistical equivalence
            difference = abs(composition_rate - legacy_rate)
            assert difference < tolerance, \
                f"{personality}: Composition {composition_rate:.3f} vs Legacy {legacy_rate:.3f} (diff: {difference:.3f})"

            print(f"‚úÖ {personality}: Composition {composition_rate:.3f} ‚âà Legacy {legacy_rate:.3f}")
```

### Performance Benchmarking

```python
def benchmark_sorta_implementations():
    """Compare performance between composition and legacy implementations"""
    import time

    iterations = 10000

    # Benchmark composition implementation
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    for i in range(iterations):
        sorta_print_composition(f"test_{i}")
    composition_time = time.perf_counter() - start_time

    # Benchmark legacy implementation
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    for i in range(iterations):
        sorta_print_legacy(f"test_{i}")
    legacy_time = time.perf_counter() - start_time

    # Calculate overhead
    overhead = (composition_time - legacy_time) / legacy_time

    print(f"Legacy: {legacy_time:.3f}s for {iterations} iterations")
    print(f"Composition: {composition_time:.3f}s for {iterations} iterations")
    print(f"Overhead: {overhead:.1%}")

    # Verify overhead is within target (<20%)
    assert overhead < 0.20, f"Composition overhead {overhead:.1%} exceeds 20% target"
```

## üéì Educational Value

### What This Example Teaches

1. **Union Composition Pattern**: How to combine multiple probabilistic gates with OR logic
2. **Bridge Probabilities**: Fine-tuning composed behavior for personality consistency
3. **Graceful Fallback**: Maintaining reliability when composition fails
4. **Statistical Equivalence**: Ensuring composed constructs behave identically to legacy
5. **Performance Parity**: Keeping composition overhead within acceptable limits

### Key Insights for Developers

1. **Transparency Creates Understanding**: Developers can see exactly how ~sorta emerges from ~sometimes + ~maybe
2. **Composition Enables Flexibility**: Individual components can be modified to affect overall behavior
3. **Mathematical Foundations Matter**: Union probability calculations ensure predictable behavior
4. **Personality Integration Is Systematic**: Bridge probabilities provide consistent personality adaptation
5. **Backward Compatibility Is Essential**: Composition should enhance, not replace, existing functionality

## üîÑ Variations and Extensions

### Alternative Composition Strategies

**Sequential Composition** (gate1 THEN gate2):
```python
def sorta_print_sequential(*args):
    """Alternative: Sequential composition"""
    if sometimes(True):        # First check
        if maybe(True):        # Second check only if first succeeds
            print(f"[print] {' '.join(map(str, args))}")
        else:
            shrug_response(args)
    else:
        shrug_response(args)
```

**Weighted Composition**:
```python
def sorta_print_weighted(*args):
    """Alternative: Weighted composition"""
    sometimes_weight = 0.6
    maybe_weight = 0.4

    sometimes_result = sometimes(True) * sometimes_weight
    maybe_result = maybe(True) * maybe_weight

    combined_score = sometimes_result + maybe_result
    if combined_score >= 0.5:  # Threshold
        print(f"[print] {' '.join(map(str, args))}")
    else:
        shrug_response(args)
```

### Framework Integration

**Using CompositionPatternFactory**:
```python
def create_sorta_pattern_with_factory():
    """Create ~sorta pattern using the composition framework"""
    from kinda.composition import CompositionPatternFactory, get_composition_engine

    # Define bridge configuration
    bridge_config = {
        "reliable": 0.0,
        "cautious": 0.0,
        "playful": 0.0,
        "chaotic": 0.02,
    }

    # Create union pattern
    sorta_pattern = CompositionPatternFactory.create_union_pattern(
        name="sorta_print_pattern",
        constructs=["sometimes", "maybe"],
        bridge_probs=bridge_config
    )

    # Register with framework
    engine = get_composition_engine()
    engine.register_composite(sorta_pattern)

    return sorta_pattern

def sorta_print_framework(*args):
    """Use framework-registered pattern"""
    from kinda.composition import get_composition_engine

    engine = get_composition_engine()
    pattern = engine.get_composite("sorta_print_pattern")

    if pattern is None:
        pattern = create_sorta_pattern_with_factory()

    # Execute composition
    if pattern.compose(True):
        print(f"[print] {' '.join(map(str, args))}")
    else:
        shrug_response(args)
```

## üéØ Next Steps

This ~sorta composition example demonstrates the foundation of the "Kinda builds Kinda" principle. To continue learning:

1. **Study [~ish Composition Example](./ish-composition.md)** - Learn tolerance-based composition
2. **Try [Custom Construct Example](./custom-construct.md)** - Build your own composition
3. **Explore [Performance Analysis](./performance-analysis.md)** - Understand optimization techniques
