"""
Comprehensive statistical testing for Issue #106 fix.

This test suite validates that ~sorta print now executes with ~80% probability
instead of the broken 100% execution rate.

Test Requirements from Architect:
1. Statistical test: 500 iterations verifying 70-90% execution rate
2. Cross-personality testing: All 4 personalities × 3 chaos levels
3. Validate no configuration shows 100% or 0% execution
