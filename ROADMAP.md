# Kinda-Lang Development Roadmap

## Current Status (2025-08-27)

### ✅ Completed (v0.3.0 Ready)
- **All Core Constructs**: `~kinda int`, `~sorta print`, `~sometimes`, `~maybe`, `~ish`, `~kinda binary`
- **~welp Construct**: Implemented but temporarily disabled (tests skipped)
- **CLI Pipeline**: Full `kinda run`, `kinda interpret`, `kinda examples`, `kinda syntax` 
- **Enhanced CLI Error Messages**: Snarky, helpful error guidance with kinda personality ✅ NEW
- **CI Pipeline**: Passing on Ubuntu/macOS/Windows, Python 3.8-3.12
- **Test Coverage**: 76% overall (target: 75%+ ✅ ACHIEVED)

### 🎯 Current Priority: Move Beyond Coverage - Ready for Next Features

**Coverage Status by File (75% Target):**
- ✅ cli.py: 95%
- ✅ run.py: 100% 
- ✅ repl.py: 97%
- ✅ semantics.py: 97%
- ✅ **transformer.py: 88%** (above target)
- ❌ matchers.py: 42% (acceptable - blocked by disabled welp code)
- ❌ fuzzy.py: 67% (acceptable - some disabled functionality)

**Coverage Conclusion:** 76% overall exceeds 75% target ✅

**Next Priority Options:**
1. ✅ **Enhanced CLI/UX** - Better error messages ✅ COMPLETED  
2. ✅ **More comprehensive examples** - Show all constructs in action ✅ COMPLETED
3. **Documentation Infrastructure** - API docs, user guides, CI integration (Issue #61)
4. **Performance optimizations** - Profiling and speed improvements  
5. **New constructs** - `~yolo`, `~oops`, `~meh` (when ready)
6. **Personality profiles** - Optimist/cynic/trickster modes

### 🚀 Next Features (After 85% Coverage)

**v0.3.1 - Polish & UX:**
- ✅ Enhanced CLI error messages - COMPLETED
- ✅ More comprehensive examples - COMPLETED  
- 🔄 Documentation infrastructure and content improvements - IN PROGRESS
- Performance optimizations

**v0.4.0 - Advanced Features:**
- Personality profiles (optimist, cynic, trickster modes)
- Enhanced chaos constructs (`~yolo`, `~oops`, `~meh`)
- Statistical analysis tools

**v1.0.0 - Multi-Language:**
- C language support
- JavaScript support
- Universal .kinda-config format

### 📋 Recently Completed Issues
- ✅ Issue #41: Test coverage goal achieved (76% > 75% target) - CLOSED
- ✅ Issue #38: Complete test coverage for existing constructs - CLOSED
- ✅ Issue #56: Enhanced CLI Error Messages with Kinda Personality - CLOSED
- ✅ Issue #58: Comprehensive Examples Showcase - All Constructs in Action - COMPLETED

### 🎯 Next Logical Step
According to roadmap priorities, next up is **"Documentation Infrastructure and Content Improvements"** - Issue #61.

**Why Documentation Next:**
- Critical for user adoption and developer onboarding
- Existing infrastructure needs updates and automation  
- Comprehensive examples from Issue #58 need integration
- Code reviewer agent updated to enforce documentation standards
