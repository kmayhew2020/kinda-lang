### 🚀 Active Development Roadmap

**v0.4.0 - Enhanced Features & C Transpiler (CURRENT):**
- ✅ **Personality System Integration**: Complete chaos-personality integration (Issue #73) - MERGED
  - 4 personality modes: reliable, cautious, playful, chaotic
  - ALL 9 constructs now personality-aware
  - CLI --mood flag support
  - Cascade failure tracking & instability system
- 🔄 **Enhanced Chaos Constructs**: Time-based drift, cascade failures (Epic #35)
- 🔄 **Documentation Enhancement**: Complex usage patterns, domain examples (Epic #76)
- 🔄 **C Language Support**: Complete C transpiler pipeline (Epic #19)

**v0.5.0 - Advanced Personality & User Experience (PLANNED):**
- 🎭 **10 Personality Modes**: Expand from 4 to 10 distinct personalities (Issue #77)
  - Reliability spectrum: ultra_reliable → reliable → cautious
  - Standard range: playful → mischievous  
  - Chaotic spectrum: chaotic → unpredictable → anarchic
  - Specialized: pessimistic, optimistic personalities
- **Advanced Personality Features**: Custom personalities, personality mixing
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Improved CLI, better error messages

### 📋 Recently Completed Issues (v0.4.0)
- ✅ Issue #73: Chaos-Personality Integration - Complete personality system with 4 modes - MERGED
- ✅ All 9 constructs now personality-aware with --mood flag support
- ✅ Cascade failure tracking and instability system implemented
- 🎭 **Personality System Analysis Complete**: Confirmed dramatic behavioral differences between modes
  - Reliable: High consistency, professional messaging
  - Chaotic: High variance, dismissive messages, extreme fuzzing
  - Playful: Moderate chaos, whimsical messages
  - Cautious: Conservative approach, careful messaging

### 📋 Previously Completed Issues (v0.3.0)
- ✅ Issue #59: ~ish Integration Syntax Fix with ~maybe/~sometimes - CLOSED
- ✅ Issue #63: Documentation Infrastructure and Content Improvements - CLOSED
- ✅ Issue #58: Comprehensive Examples Showcase - All Constructs in Action - CLOSED
- ✅ Issue #56: Enhanced CLI Error Messages with Kinda Personality - CLOSED
- ✅ Issue #41: Test coverage goal achieved (75% target) - CLOSED
- ✅ Issue #38: Complete test coverage for existing constructs - CLOSED

### 🐛 Active Bug Fixes (v0.4.0)
- 🔴 **Issue #79**: Block else syntax (`} {`) doesn't transform correctly - HIGH PRIORITY
- ✅ **Issue #80**: `~ish` operator doesn't assign result back to variable - **FIXED in PR #85**
- 🔴 **Issue #81**: Constructs inside function arguments not transformed - HIGH PRIORITY **[CONFIRMED via play testing]**
- ✅ **Issue #82**: `~ish` returns value instead of modifying in-place - **FIXED in PR #85**
- ✅ **Issue #83**: `~ish` transformer uses wrong function (ish_comparison vs ish_value) - **FIXED in PR #85**
- 🟡 **Issue #84**: Documentation: `~ish` construct usage patterns need clarification - MEDIUM

### 🔍 New Issues from Expert Analysis & Play Testing
- 🟡 **Issue #86**: Feature: Add determinism controls (--seed, --chaos flags) - MEDIUM
- 🟡 **Issue #87**: Docs: Create comprehensive ~ish usage guide - MEDIUM  
- 🟠 **Issue #88**: Feature: Single-source spec.yaml → docs + CLI to prevent drift - MEDIUM-HIGH
- 🟠 **Issue #89**: DX: Add source maps for error reporting (.knda line/col in stack traces) - MEDIUM

### 🎯 Current Priorities (v0.4.0)

**Active Development:**
1. **Critical Bug Fixes**: Address remaining transformer issues (Issues #79, #81)
2. **Documentation Completion**: Address documentation gaps (#84, #87) 
3. **Enhanced Chaos Constructs**: New fuzzy constructs and behaviors (Epic #35)
4. **Time-based Variable Drift**: Variables get fuzzier over program lifetime (Issue #74)
5. **C Language Support**: Complete C transpiler pipeline (Epic #19)

**New v0.4.0 Enhancements (Expert-Driven):**
6. **Determinism Controls**: --seed and --chaos flags for reproducibility (#86)
7. **Single-Source Spec**: Prevent docs/code drift with spec.yaml (#88)
8. **Enhanced DX**: Source maps for better error reporting (#89)

**Future Planning (v0.5.0):**
9. **10 Personality Expansion**: Expand personality system to 10 distinct modes (Issue #77)

### 💡 Enhancement Ideas from Personality Analysis
- **Personality Intensity Levels**: `--mood chaotic-extreme`, `--mood reliable-strict`
- **Dynamic Personality Shifts**: Personality changes during execution based on success/failure
- **Construct-Specific Tuning**: Different personalities for different constructs
- **Personality Memory**: Recent execution history influences future probability
- **Interactive Personality Modes**: User prompts during execution

**PROGRESS UPDATE**: Major bug fixes completed, expert analysis integrated:
- ✅ **Issue #83 RESOLVED**: Critical ~ish transformer bug fixed (PR #85)
- 🔴 **Issue #81 CONFIRMED**: Nested constructs in function args still broken (play testing)  
- 🔍 **Expert Analysis**: 4 new enhancement issues identified (#86-89)
- 📋 **Documentation**: Comprehensive ~ish guide needed (#87) 
- **Priority Recommendation**: Complete remaining critical bugs (#79, #81) before Epic #35

### 🏆 Recent Accomplishments  
- ✅ **Personality System**: Complete integration with all 9 constructs
- ✅ **Critical ~ish Fix**: Variable modification now works correctly
- ✅ **Process Enhancement**: Mandatory documentation review prevents bugs
- ✅ **Expert Validation**: Comprehensive analysis confirms solid foundation

### 📊 Stress Testing Results Summary
**Comprehensive testing revealed**:
- ✅ Personality system works perfectly with dramatic behavioral differences
- ✅ CLI `--mood` integration seamless and effective  
- 🚨 5 critical transformer bugs affecting core constructs
- 🎯 Language expressiveness significantly limited by parsing issues
