**v0.5.0 - Advanced Personality & User Experience (PLANNED):**
- 🎭 **10 Personality Modes**: Expand from 4 to 10 distinct personalities (Issue #77)
  - Reliability spectrum: ultra_reliable → reliable → cautious
  - Standard range: playful → mischievous  
  - Chaotic spectrum: chaotic → unpredictable → anarchic
  - Specialized: pessimistic, optimistic personalities
- **Advanced Personality Features**: Custom personalities, personality mixing
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Improved CLI, better error messages

### 📋 Recently Completed Issues (v0.4.0)

- ✅ All 9 constructs now personality-aware with --mood flag support
- ✅ Cascade failure tracking and instability system implemented
- 🎭 **Personality System Analysis Complete**: Confirmed dramatic behavioral differences between modes
  - Reliable: High consistency, professional messaging
  - Chaotic: High variance, dismissive messages, extreme fuzzing
  - Playful: Moderate chaos, whimsical messages
  - Cautious: Conservative approach, careful messaging

- ✅ **Issue #80**: `~ish` operator doesn't assign result back to variable - **FIXED in PR #85**
- ✅ **Issue #81**: Constructs inside function arguments not transformed - **FIXED in PR #95**
- ✅ **Issue #82**: `~ish` returns value instead of modifying in-place - **FIXED in PR #85**
- ✅ **Issue #83**: `~ish` transformer uses wrong function (ish_comparison vs ish_value) - **FIXED in PR #85**
- 🟡 **Issue #84**: Documentation: `~ish` construct usage patterns need clarification - MEDIUM

### 🔍 New Issues from Expert Analysis & Play Testing
- 🟡 **Issue #86**: Feature: Add determinism controls (--seed, --chaos flags) - MEDIUM
- 🟡 **Issue #87**: Docs: Create comprehensive ~ish usage guide - MEDIUM  
- 🟠 **Issue #88**: Feature: Single-source spec.yaml → docs + CLI to prevent drift - MEDIUM-HIGH
- 🟠 **Issue #89**: DX: Add source maps for error reporting (.knda line/col in stack traces) - MEDIUM

### 🎯 Current Priorities (v0.4.0) - PRIORITY SYSTEM ESTABLISHED

**✅ COMPLETED:**
1. **Critical Bug Fixes**: All transformer issues resolved (Issues #79, #81) - **COMPLETED**
2. **Priority System**: GitHub labels created and all issues properly prioritized

**🔴 HIGH PRIORITY (Active Development):**
1. **Epic #35**: 🎲 Enhanced Chaos Constructs - New fuzzy constructs and behaviors
2. **Issue #74**: ⏰ Time-based Variable Drift - Variables get fuzzier over program lifetime

**🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Documentation & Features):**
3. **Issue #84**: 📖 Documentation: ~ish construct usage patterns need clarification  
4. **Issue #87**: 📘 Docs: Create comprehensive ~ish usage guide
5. **Issue #86**: ⚙️ Feature: Add determinism controls (--seed, --chaos flags)
6. **Epic #19**: 🔧 C Language Support - Complete C transpiler pipeline

**🟢 LOW PRIORITY (Future Enhancement):**
7. **Issue #88**: 🔧 Feature: Single-source spec.yaml → docs + CLI to prevent drift
8. **Issue #89**: 🛠️ DX: Add source maps for error reporting (.knda line/col in stack traces)

**🔮 FUTURE PLANNING (v0.5.0):**
9. **Issue #77**: 🎭 10 Personality Expansion - Expand from 4 to 10 distinct personality modes

### 💡 Enhancement Ideas from Personality Analysis
- **Personality Intensity Levels**: `--mood chaotic-extreme`, `--mood reliable-strict`
- **Dynamic Personality Shifts**: Personality changes during execution based on success/failure
- **Construct-Specific Tuning**: Different personalities for different constructs
- **Personality Memory**: Recent execution history influences future probability
- **Interactive Personality Modes**: User prompts during execution

- ✅ **Issue #83 RESOLVED**: Critical ~ish transformer bug fixed (PR #85)
- ✅ **Issue #79 RESOLVED**: Block else syntax now working (PR #95)
- ✅ **Issue #81 RESOLVED**: Nested constructs in function args fixed (PR #95)
- 🔍 **Expert Analysis**: 4 new enhancement issues identified (#86-89)
- 📋 **Documentation**: Comprehensive ~ish guide needed (#87) 
- ✅ **Priority Completed**: All critical bugs resolved - ready for Epic #35

### 🏆 Recent Accomplishments
