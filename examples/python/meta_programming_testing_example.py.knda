# Meta-Programming Testing Example: "Kinda Tests Kinda" Philosophy
# =============================================================
# This example demonstrates the ultimate expression of the kinda-lang philosophy:
# using kinda constructs to test other kinda constructs, creating recursive
# meta-programming patterns that showcase sophisticated probabilistic testing.

# Import statistical assertion constructs
~assert_eventually
~assert_probability

# Example 1: Basic Meta-Validation
# Tests where kinda constructs validate themselves
print("🎯 Basic Meta-Validation Example")

~kinda bool meta_result = ~sometimes True
~assert_eventually (~sometimes (meta_result == ~sometimes True), timeout=2.0, confidence=0.4)
~sorta (print("✅ Meta-validation: ~sometimes tested itself!"))

# Example 2: Probabilistic Parameter Self-Determination
# Using ~maybe and ~rarely to determine test parameters dynamically
print("\n🔄 Dynamic Parameter Generation")

~kinda float fuzzy_expected_prob = ~maybe 0.6 if True else 0.4  # ~maybe 60% or 40%
~kinda int fuzzy_samples = (~rarely 500 if True else 100)       # ~rarely high sample count
~kinda float fuzzy_tolerance = (~probably 0.1 if True else 0.2) # ~probably strict tolerance

print(f"Dynamic parameters: prob={fuzzy_expected_prob}, samples={fuzzy_samples}, tolerance={fuzzy_tolerance}")

# Test ~maybe with dynamically generated parameters
~assert_probability (~maybe True, expected_prob=fuzzy_expected_prob, tolerance=fuzzy_tolerance, samples=fuzzy_samples)
~sorta (print("✅ Dynamic parameters: ~maybe tested with self-generated fuzzy parameters!"))

# Example 3: Compound Meta-Validation 
# Tests that combine multiple kinda constructs for complex validation
print("\n🌀 Compound Meta-Construct Testing")

# Test the interaction between ~sometimes and ~maybe
~assert_probability (~sometimes (~maybe True), expected_prob=0.30, tolerance=0.15, samples=200)
~sorta (print("✅ Compound: ~sometimes and ~maybe interaction validated!"))

# Test ~rarely nested in ~probably
~assert_probability (~probably (~rarely True), expected_prob=0.105, tolerance=0.05, samples=300) 
~sorta (print("✅ Compound: ~probably(~rarely) nested validation complete!"))

# Example 4: Time-Based Meta-Testing
# Using kinda constructs to test time-dependent behavior
print("\n⏱️ Time-Based Meta-Testing")

~kinda int time_counter = 0
~sometimes (time_counter = time_counter + 1)  # Increment ~sometimes

# Validate that time_counter grows over multiple iterations
~kinda bool eventually_incremented = False
~assert_eventually ((time_counter > 0), timeout=1.0, confidence=0.7)

~sorta print(f"✅ Time-based: Counter reached {time_counter} (temporal meta-validation)")

# Example 5: Recursive Meta-Framework Demonstration
# The ultimate expression: a test that tests the testing framework
print("\n🎭 Recursive Meta-Framework Pattern")

# Meta-validation of the testing framework itself
~kinda bool framework_working = True

# Test that assert_eventually can validate itself
~assert_eventually ((framework_working == ~sometimes True), timeout=1.5, confidence=0.5)

# Test that assert_probability can validate its own behavior
~kinda int meta_success_count = 0
~probably (meta_success_count = meta_success_count + (~maybe 1 if True else 0))
~assert_probability ((meta_success_count > 0), expected_prob=0.42, tolerance=0.2, samples=100)

~sorta (print("✅ Recursive: Meta-framework validated its own meta-validation capabilities!"))

# Example 6: Chaos-Tolerant Meta-Testing
# Showing how meta-tests can adapt to different chaos levels
print("\n🌪️ Chaos-Adaptive Meta-Testing")

# Tests that adjust their expectations based on inherent uncertainty
~kinda float chaos_factor = ~maybe 1.5 if True else 0.8  # Chaos amplifier

# Adaptive assertion that tolerates chaos
~kinda float adaptive_prob = 0.5 * chaos_factor  # Scale expectation by chaos
~assert_probability (~sometimes True, expected_prob=adaptive_prob, tolerance=0.3, samples=150)

~sorta print(f"✅ Chaos-adaptive: Validated with chaos factor {chaos_factor}")

# Example 7: Meta-Statistical Validation
# Using statistical assertions to validate statistical behavior
print("\n📊 Meta-Statistical Analysis")

# Validate that our assertions have reasonable success rates
~kinda int assertion_successes = 0
~kinda int total_assertions = 5  # We've run about 5 major assertions above

# Meta-assertion about assertion success rate
~probably (assertion_successes = assertion_successes + (~maybe 1 if True else 0))
~assert_probability ((assertion_successes >= 2), expected_prob=0.8, tolerance=0.2, samples=50)

~sorta print(f"✅ Meta-statistical: Assertion success rate meta-validated!")

# Example 8: Ultimate Meta-Programming: Self-Modifying Test Logic
# Tests that use kinda constructs to modify their own testing behavior
print("\n🎪 Self-Modifying Meta-Test Logic")

test_mode = (~sometimes "strict") if True else "lenient"
~kinda float dynamic_confidence = (~maybe 0.9 if test_mode == "strict" else 0.6)
~kinda float dynamic_timeout = (~rarely 3.0 if test_mode == "strict" else 1.0)

print(f"Self-adapting test mode: {test_mode}")
print(f"Dynamic confidence: {dynamic_confidence}")
print(f"Dynamic timeout: {dynamic_timeout}")

# Execute self-modifying validation
~assert_eventually (~sometimes (test_mode != "impossible"), timeout=dynamic_timeout, confidence=dynamic_confidence)

~sorta print(f"✅ Self-modifying: Test adapted its behavior based on ~{test_mode} mode!")
